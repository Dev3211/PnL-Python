# PnL-Python

Profit and Loss calculator written in Python, it has the basic and the advanced version. The basic version is basically a simple arithmetic of finding either the loss or profit and the advanced version is used to find if the cost price if it's not given or the sell price.

If you are using the advanced version and you want to leave a field empty, just write 0 and press enter; yes it's a console script. All you need to do is just start the script and either type 'advanced' or 'basic'
